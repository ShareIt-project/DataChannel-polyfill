    <p>This document defines a set of ECMAScript APIs in WebIDL to allow media
    to be sent to and received from another browser or device implementing the
    appropriate set of real-time protocols. This specification is being
    developed in conjunction with a protocol specification developed by the
    IETF RTCWEB group and an API specification to get access to local media
    devices developed by the Media Capture Task Force.</p>

  <section id="sotd">
    <p>This document is neither complete nor stable, and as such is not yet
    suitable for commercial implementation. However, early experimentation is
    encouraged. The API is based on preliminary work done in the WHATWG. The
    Web Real-Time Communications Working Group expects this specification to
    evolve significantly based on:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The outcome of ongoing exchanges in the companion RTCWEB group at
      IETF to define the set of protocols that, together with this document,
      will enable real-time communications in Web browsers.</li>

      <li>Privacy issues that arise when exposing local capabilities and local
      streams.</li>

      <li>Technical discussions within the group.</li>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>There are a number of facets to video-conferencing in HTML covered by
    this specification:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Connecting to remote peers using NAT-traversal technologies such as
      ICE, STUN, and TURN.</li>

      <li>Sending the locally-produced streams to remote peers and receiving
      streams from remote peers.</li>

      <li>Sending arbitrary data directly to remote peers.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This document defines the APIs used for these features. This
    specification is being developed in conjunction with a protocol
    specification developed by the <a href=
    "http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/rtcweb/">IETF RTCWEB group</a> and an API
    specification to get access to local media devices developed by the

    <p>Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in
    this specification must implement them in a manner consistent with the
    ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification [[!WEBIDL]], as
    this specification uses that specification and terminology.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p>An <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> allows two users to
      communicate directly, browser to browser. Communications are coordinated
      via a signaling channel which is provided by unspecified means, but
      generally by a script in the page via the server, e.g. using
      <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>.</p>
    </section>

      <h3>Configuration</h3>

      <section>
        <h4>RTCConfiguration Type</h4>

        <dl class="idl" title="dictionary RTCConfiguration">
          <dt>RTCIceServer[] iceServers</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>An array containing STUN and TURN servers available to be used
            by ICE.</p>
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>RTCIceServer Type</h4>

        <dl class="idl" title="dictionary RTCIceServer">
          <dt>DOMString url</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>A STUN or TURN URI as defined in [[!STUN-URI]] and
            [[!TURN-URI]].</p>
          </dd>

          <dt>DOMString? credential</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>If the url element of the internal array is a TURN URI, then
            this is the credential to use with that TURN server.</p>
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>In network topologies with multiple layers of NATs, it is desirable
        to have a STUN server between every layer of NATs in addition to the
        TURN servers to minimize the peer to peer network latency.</p>

        <p>An example array of RTCIceServer objects is:</p>

        <p><code>[ { url:"stun:stun.example.net"] } , {
        url:"turn:user@turn.example.org", credential:"myPassword"} ]</code></p>

      <h3>RTCPeerConnection Interface</h3>

      <p>The general operation of the RTCPeerConnection is described in
      [[RTCWEB-JSEP]].</p>

      <section>
        <h4>Operation</h4>

        <p>Calling <code>new <a>RTCPeerConnection</a>(<var>configuration</var>
        )</code> creates an <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object.</p>

        <p>The <var>configuration</var> has the information to find and access
        the [[!STUN]] and [[!TURN]] servers. There may be multiple servers of
        each type and any TURN server also acts as a STUN server.</p>

        <p>An <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object has an associated
        <dfn id="rtcpeerconnection-ice-agent">ICE agent</dfn>, [[!ICE]]
        <dfn id="rtcpeerconnection-readiness-state">RTCPeerConnection readiness
        state</dfn>, and ICE state. These are initialized when the object is
        created.</p>

        <p>When the <dfn id=
        "dom-peerconnection"><code>RTCPeerConnection()</code></dfn> constructor
        is invoked, the user agent MUST run the following steps. This algorithm
        has a synchronous section (which is triggered as part of the event loop
        algorithm).</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Create an ICE Agent and let <var>connection</var>'s <a href=
            "#rtcpeerconnection-ice-agent"><code>RTCPeerConnection</code> ICE
            Agent</a> be that ICE Agent and provide it the STUN and TURN
            servers from the configuration array. The ICE Agent will proceed
            with gathering as soon as the IceTransports constraint is not set
            to "none". At this point the ICE Agent does not know how many ICE
            components it needs (and hence the number of candidates to gather),
            but it can make a reasonable assumption. As the
            <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> object gets more information, the
            ICE Agent can adjust the number of components.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Set <var>connection</var>'s <a href=
            "#rtcpeerconnection-readiness-state"><code>RTCPeerConnection</code>
            readiness state</a> to <code>new</code>.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Set <var>connection</var>'s <a href=
            "#rtcpeerconnection-readiness-state"><code>RTCPeerConnection</code>
            ice state</a> to <code>new</code>.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Initialize an internal variable to represent a queue of
            <code>operations</code> with an empty set.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Let <var>connection</var>'s <code title=
            "dom-RTCPeerConnection-localStreams"><a href=
            "#widl-RTCPeerConnection-localStreams">localStreams</a></code>
            attribute be an empty read-only <code><a>MediaStream</a></code>
            array.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Let <var>connection</var>'s <code title=
            "dom-RTCPeerConnection-remoteStreams"><a href=
            "#widl-RTCPeerConnection-remoteStreams">remoteStreams</a></code>
            attribute be an empty read-only <code><a>MediaStream</a></code>
            array.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Return <var>connection</var>, but continue these steps
            asynchronously.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Await a stable state. The synchronous section consists of the
            remaining steps of this algorithm.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Once the RTCPeerConnection object has been initialized, for every
        call to <code>createOffer</code>, <code>setLocalDescription</code>,
        <code>createAnswer</code> and <code>setRemoteDescription</code>;
        execute the following steps:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Append an object representing the current call being handled
            (i.e. function name and corresponding arguments) to the
            <code>operations</code> array.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>If the length of the <code>operations</code> array is exactly 1,
            execute the function from the front of the queue asynchronously.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>When the ascynchronous operation completes (either successfully
            or with an error), remove the corresponding object from the
            <code>operations</code> array. After removal, if the array is
            non-empty, execute the first object queued asynchronously and
            repeat this step on completion.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>The general idea is to have only one among <code>createOffer</code>,
        <code>setLocalDescription</code>, <code>createAnswer</code> and
        <code>setRemoteDescription</code> executing at any given time. If
        subsequent calls are made while one of them is still executing, they
        are added to a queue and processed when the previous operation is fully
        completed. It is valid, and expected, for normal error handling
        procedures to be applied.</p>

        <p>Additionally, during the lifetime of the RTCPeerConnection object,
        the following procedures are followed when an ICE event occurs:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>If <var>iceState</var> is "new" and the IceTransports constraint
            is not set to "none", it MUST queue a task to start gathering ICE
            addresses and set the <var>iceState</var> to "gathering".</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>If the ICE Agent has found one or more candidate pairs for each
            MediaStreamTrack that forms a valid connection, the ICE state is
            changed to "connected".</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>When the ICE Agent finishes checking all candidate pairs, if at
            least one connection has been found for each MediaStreamTrack, the
            <var>iceState</var> is changed to "completed"; else the iceState is
            changed to "failed".</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>If the <var>iceState</var> is "connected" or "completed" and
            both the local and remote session descriptions are set, the
            RTCPeerConnection state is set to "active".</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>If the <var>iceState</var> is "failed", a task is queued to call
            the close method.</p>

            <p class="issue">ISSUE:: CJ - this seems wrong to me.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>User agents negotiate the codec resolution, bitrate, and other media
        parameters. It is RECOMMENDED that user agents initially negotiate for
        the maximum resolution of a video stream. For streams that are then
        rendered (using a <code>video</code> element), it is RECOMMENDED that
        user agents renegotiate for a resolution that matches the rendered
        display size.</p>

        <!--
          <p>All SDP media descriptions for RTP flows represented by <code>
              <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
            </code> objects MUST include a label attribute ("<code
          title="">a=label:</code>") whose value is the value of the <code>
              <a>MediaStream</a>
            </code> object's <code title="dom-MediaStream-label">

        <p>The word "components" in this context refers to an RTP media flow

        <p>When a user agent has reached the point where a
        <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> can be created to represent incoming
        components, the user agent MUST run the following steps:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Let <var>connection</var> be the
            <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> expecting this media.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Create a <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> object

          <dd>
            <p>The createOffer method generates a blob of SDP that contains an
            RFC 3264 offer with the supported configurations for the session,
            including descriptions of the local <code>MediaStream</code>s
            attached to this <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>, the codec/RTP/RTCP
            options supported by this implementation, and any candidates that
            have been gathered by the ICE Agent. The constraints parameter may
            be supplied to provide additional control over the offer generated.
            More information about constraints can be found in
            [[!RTCWEB-CONSTRAINTS]].</p>

            <p>As an offer, the generated SDP will contain the full set of
            capabilities supported by the session (as opposed to an answer,
            which will include only a specific negotiated subset to use); for
            each SDP line, the generation of the SDP must follow the
            appropriate process for generating an offer. In the event
            createOffer is called after the session is established, createOffer
            will generate an offer that is compatible with the current session,
            incorporating any changes that have been made to the session since
            the last complete offer-answer exchange, such as addition or
            removal of streams. If no changes have been made, the offer will
            include the capabilities of the current local description as well
            as any additional capabilities that could be negotiated in an
            updated offer.</p>

            <p>Session descriptions generated by createOffer MUST be
            immediately usable by setLocalDescription without causing an error
            as long as setLocalDiscription is called within the successCallback
            function. If a system has limited resources (e.g. a finite number
            of decoders), createOffer needs to return an offer that reflects
            the current state of the system, so that setLocalDescription will
            succeed when it attempts to acquire those resources. The session
            descriptions MUST remain usable by setLocalDescription without
            causing an error until at least end of the successCallback
            function. Calling this method is needed to get the ICE user name
            fragment and password.</p>

            <p>If the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> is configured to generate
            Identity assertions, then the session description SHALL contain an
            appropriate assertion.</p>

            agent MUST queue a task to invoke <var>successCallback</var> with a
            newly created <code><a>RTCSessionDescription</a></code> object,
            representing the generated offer, as its argument.</p>

            <p>An exception with an <code>RTCError</code> object of type
            <code>INVALID_CONSTRAINTS_TYPE</code> is thrown if the constraints
            parameter is malformed, and an <code>RTCError</code> object of type

          <dd>The ICE Agent has found a usable connection for all components

      <section>
        <h4>General Principles</h4>

        <p>Errors are indicated in two ways: exceptions and objects passed to
        error callbacks. Both forms of error reporting MUST provide an object
        of type <code>RTCError</code>. An exception MUST be thrown in the
        following cases:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The type of any argument passed to a function did not match what
          was expected. An appropriate string from the
          <code>RTCExceptionName</code> enum MUST be used as the error
          name.</li>

          <li>A function call was made when the RTCPeerConnection is in an
          invalid state, or a state in which that particular function is not
          allowed to be executed. In this case, the string
          <code>INVALID_STATE</code> MUST be used as the error name.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In all other cases, an error object MUST be provided to the failure
        callback. The error name in the object provided MUST be picked from
        either the <code>RTCExceptionName</code> or <code>RTCErrorName</code>
        enums.</p>

      <h3>RTCDataChannel</h3>

      <p>The <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> interface represents a
      bi-directional data channel between two peers. A
      <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> is created via a factory method on an
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object. The corresponding
      <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> object is then dispatched at the other
      peer if the channel setup was successful.</p>

      <p>Each <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> has an associated
      <dfn>underlying data transport</dfn> that is used to transport actual
      data to the other peer. The transport properties of the <a>underlying
      data transport</a>, such as reliability mode, are configured by the peer
      taking the initiative to create the channel. The other peer cannot change
      any transport properties of an offered data channel. The actual wire
      protocol between the peers is out of the scope for this
      specification.</p>

      <p>A <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> created with <code><a href=
      "#dom-peerconnection-createdatachannel">createDataChannel()</a></code>
      MUST initially be in the <code>connecting</code> state. If the
      <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> object’s <a>underlying data
      transport</a> is successfully set up, the user agent MUST <a href=
      "#announce-datachannel-open">announce the <code>RTCDataChannel</code> as
      open</a>.</p>

      <p>When the user agent is to <dfn id="announce-datachannel-open">announce
      a <code>RTCDataChannel</code> as open</dfn>, the user agent MUST queue a
      task to run the following steps:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>If the associated <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object's
          <a href=
          "#rtcpeerconnection-readiness-state"><code>RTCPeerConnection</code>
          readiness state</a> is <code>closed</code>, abort these steps.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Let <var>channel</var> be the <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code>
          object to be announced.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Set <var>channel</var>'s <code><a href=
          "#dom-datachannel-readystate">readyState</a></code> attribute to

        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>When an <a>underlying data transport</a> has been established, the
      user agent of the peer that did not initiate the creation process MUST
      queue a task to run the following steps:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>If the associated <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object's

          readiness state</a> is <code>closed</code>, abort these steps.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Let <var>configuration</var> be an information bundle with
          key-value pairs, received from the other peer as a part of the
          process to establish the <a>underlying data channel</a>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Let <var>channel</var> be a newly created
          <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> object.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p>The basic statistics model is that the browser maintains a set of
      statistics indexed by <code>selector</code>. The "selector" may be a
      <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> that is a member of a
      <code>MediaStream</code> on the incoming or outgoing streams. The calling
      Web application provides the selector to the <code>getStats()</code>
      method and the browser returns (in the JavaScript) a set of statistics
      that it believes is relevant to the selector.</p>

      <p>The statistics returned are designed in such a way that repeated
      queries yield the same statistics in the same place in the structure.
      Thus, a Web application can make measurements over a given time period by
      requesting measurements at the beginning and end of that period.</p>

      <h3>RTCStatsElement dictionary</h3>

      <p>Each <code>RTCStatsElement</code> object consists of two
      <code>RTCStatsReport</code> objects, one corresponding to local
      statistics and one to remote statistics.</p>

      <dl class="idl" title="dictionary RTCStatsElement">
        <dt>RTCStatsReport local</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>The statistics corresponding to local properties.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>RTCStatsReport remote</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>The statistics corresponding to remote properties.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>

    <section>
      <h3>RTCStatsReport Type</h3>

      <p>Each <code>RTCStatsReport</code> has a timestamp. Individual
      statistics are accessed by passing string names to the <code><a href=
      "#dom-rtcstatsreport-getvalue">getValue()</a></code> method. Note that
      while stats names are standardized [[OPEN ISSUE: Need to define an IANA
      registry for this and populate with pointers to existing things such as
      the RTCP statistics. ]], any given implementation may be using
      experimental values or values not yet known to the Web application. Thus,
      applications MUST be prepared to deal with unknown stats.</p>

      <p>Statistics need to be synchronized with each other in order to yield
      reasonable values in computation; for instance, if "bytesSent" and
      "packetsSent" are both reported, they both need to be reported over the
      same interval, so that "average packet size" can be computed as "bytes /
      packets" - if the intervals are different, this will yield errors. Thus
      implementations MUST return synchronized values for all stats in a
      <code>RTCStatsReport</code>.</p>

      <dl class="idl" title="interface RTCStatsReport">
        <dt>readonly attribute long timestamp</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>The timestamp in milliseconds since the UNIX epoch (Jan 1, 1970,
          UTC).</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>any getValue(DOMString statName)</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>The <dfn id=
          "dom-rtcstatsreport-getvalue"><code>getValue()</code></dfn> method
          returns the value for the statistic that corresponds to
          <var>statName</var>.</p>

      <h3>Example</h3>

      <p>Consider the case where the user is experiencing bad sound and the
      application wants to determine if the cause of it is packet loss. The
      sound track is audio track 0 of remote stream 0 of pc1. The following
      example code might be used:</p>
      <pre class="example sh_javascript">
var baseline, now;
var selector = pc.remoteStreams[0].audioTracks[0];

pc.getStats(selector, function (stats) {
    baseline = stats;
});

// ... wait a bit
setTimeout(function () {
    pc.getStats(selector, function (stats) {
        now = stats;
        processStats();
    });
}, aBit);

function processStats() {
    // Real code would:
    // - Check that timestamp of “local stats” and “remote stats”
    //   are reasonably consistent.
    // - Sum up over all the elements rather than just accessing
    //   element zero.

    var packetsSent = now[0].remote.getValue("packetsSent") -
            baseline[0].remote.getValue("packetsSent");

    var packetsReceived = now[0].local.getValue("packetsReceived") -
            baseline[0].local.getValue("packetsReceived");

    // if fractionLost is &gt; 0.3, we have probably found the culprit
    var fractionLost = (packetsSent - packetsReceived) / packetsSent;
}

      <h3>Identity Provider Interaction</h3>

      <p>WebRTC offers and answers (and hence the channels established by
      <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> objects) can be authenticated by using
      web-based Identity Providers. The idea is that the entity sending the
      offer/answer acts as the Authenticating Party (AP) and obtains an
      identity assertion from the IdP which it attaches to the offer/answer.
      The consumer of the offer/answer (i.e., the
      <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> on which
      <code>setRemoteDescription()</code> is called acts as the Relying Party
      (RP) and verifies the assertion.</p>

      <p>The interaction with the IdP is designed to decouple the browser from
      any particular identity provider; the browser need only know how to load
      the IdP's JavaScript -- which is deterministic from the IdP's identity --
      and the generic protocol for requesting and verifying assertions. The IdP
      provides whatever logic is necessary to bridge the generic protocol to
      the IdP's specific requirements. Thus, a single browser can support any
      number of identity protocols, including being forward compatible with
      IdPs which did not exist at the time the browser was written. The generic
      protocol details are described in [RTCWEB-SECURITY-ARCH]. This document
      specifies the procedures required to instantiate the IdP proxy, request
      identity assertions, and consume the results.</p>

      <section>
        <h4 id="sec.identity-proxy-communications">Peer-Connection/IdP
        Communications</h4>

        <p>In order to communicate with the IdP, the browser must instantiate
        an isolated interpreted context [TODO: What's the technical term?],
        such as an invisible IFRAME. The initial contents of the context are
        loaded from a URI derived from the IdP's domain name.
        [RTCWEB-SECURITY-ARCH; Section XXX].</p>

        <p>For purposes of generating assertions, the IdP shall be chosen as
        follows:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>If the <code>setIdentityProvider()</code> method has been called,
          the IdP provided shall be used.</li>

          <li>If the <code>setIdentityProvider()</code> method has not been
          called, then the browser shall use an IdP configured into the
          browser. If more than one such IdP is configured, the browser should
          provide the user with a chooser interface.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>In order to verify assertions, the IdP domain name and protocol
        shall be equal to the "domain" and "protocol" fields of the identity
        assertion.</p>

        <p>The context MUST have a <code>MessageChannel</code> named
        <code>window.TBD</code> which is "entangled" to the
        <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> and is unique to that subcontext. This
        channel is used for messaging between the
        <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> and the IdP. All messages sent via this
        channel are strings, specifically the JSONified versions of JavaScript
        structs.</p>

        <p>All messages sent from the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> to the IdP
        context MUST have an <code>origin</code> of
        <code>rtcweb://peerconnection/</code>. The fact that ordinary Web pages
        cannot set their origin values arbitrarily is an essential security
        feature, as it stops attackers from requesting WebRTC-compatible
        identity assertions from IdPs. For this reason, the origin must be
        included in the identity assertion and verified by the consuming
        <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4 id="sec.identity-proxy-assertion-request">Requesting
        Assertions</h4>

        <p>The identity assertion request process involves the following
        steps.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> instantiates an IdP context as
          described in the previous section.</li>

          <li>The IdP serves up the IdP JavaScript code to the IdP
          context.</li>

          <li>Once the IdP is loaded and ready to receive messages it sends a
          "READY" message [RTCWEB-SECURITY-ARCH; Section 5.6.5.2]. Note that
          this does not imply that the user is logged in, merely that enough
          IdP state is booted up to be ready to handle PostMessage calls.</li>

          <li>The IdP sends a "SIGN" message (Section 5.6.5.2.2) to the IdP
          proxy context. This message includes the material the
          <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> desires to be bound to the user's
          identity.</li>

          <li>If the user is not logged in, at this point the IdP will initiate
          the login process. For instance, it might pop up a dialog box
          inviting the user to enter their (IdP) username and password.</li>

          <li>Once the user is logged in (potentially after the previous step),
          the IdP proxy generates an identity assertion (depending on the
          authentication protocol this may involve interacting with the IDP
          server).</li>

          <li>Once the assertion is generated, the IdP proxy sends a response
          (Section 5.6.5.2.2) containing the assertion to the
          <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> over the message channel.</li>

          <li>The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> stores the assertion for use
          with future offers or answers. If the identity request was triggered
          by a <code>createOffer()</code> or <code>createAnswer()</code>, then
          the assertion is inserted in the offer/answer.</li>

          calls.</li>

          <li>The IdP sends a "VERIFY" message (Section 5.6.5.2.2) to the IdP
          proxy context. This message includes assertion from the offer/answer
          which is to be verified.</li>

          <li>The IdP proxy verifies the identity assertion (depending on the
          authentication protocol this may involve interacting with the IDP
          server).</li>

          <li>Once the assertion is verified the IdP proxy sends a response
          containing the verified assertion results (Section 5.6.5.2.3) to the
          <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> over the message channel.</li>

          <li>The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> displays the assertion

    <h2>Media Stream API Extensions for Network Use</h2>

    <section>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p>The <code>MediaStream</code> interface, as defined in the
      [[!GETUSERMEDIA]] specification, typically represents a stream of data of
      audio and/or video. A <code>MediaStream</code> may be extended to
      represent a stream that either comes from or is sent to a remote node
      (and not just the local camera, for instance). The extensions required to
      enable this capability on the <code>MediaStream</code> object will be
      described in this document.</p>

      <p>A <code>MediaStream</code> as defined in [[!GETUSERMEDIA]] may contain
      zero or more <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> objects. A
      <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> sent to another peer will appear as one and
      only one <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> to the recipient. A peer is
      defined as a user agent that supports this specification.</p>

      <p>Channels are the smallest unit considered in the
      <code>MediaStream</code> specification. Channels are intended to be
      encoded together for transmission as, for instance, an RTP payload type.
      All of the channels that a codec needs to encode jointly MUST be in the
      same <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> and the codecs SHOULD be able to
      encode, or discard, all the channels in the track.</p>

      <p>The concepts of an input and output to a given
      <code>MediaStream</code> apply in the case of <code>MediaStream</code>
      objects transmitted over the network as well. A
      <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> created by an
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object (described later in this
      document) will take as input the data received from a remote peer.
      Similarly, a <code>MediaStream</code> from a local source, for instance a
      camera via [[!GETUSERMEDIA]], will have an output that represents what is
      transmitted to a remote peer if the object is used with an
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object.</p>

      <p>The concept of duplicating <code>MediaStream</code> objects as
      described in [[!GETUSERMEDIA]] is also applicable here. This feature can
      be used, for instance, in a video-conferencing scenario to display the
      local video from the user’s camera and microphone in a local monitor,
      while only transmitting the audio to the remote peer (e.g. in response to
      the user using a "video mute" feature). Combining tracks from different
      <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> objects into a new
      <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> is useful in certain situations.</p>

      <p class="note">In this document, we only specify aspects of the
      following objects that are relevant when used along with an
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code>. Please refer to the original
      definitions of the objects in the [[!GETUSERMEDIA]] document for general
      information on using <code>MediaStream</code> and
      <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>.</p>

      <h3>MediaStream</h3>

      <section>
        <h4>id</h4>

        <p>The <code><a href=
        "getusermedia.html#dom-mediastream-id">id</a></code> attribute specified
        in <code>MediaStream</code> returns an id that is unique to this stream,
        so that streams can be recognized after they are sent through the
        <code><a href="#rtcpeerconnection">RTCPeerConnection</a></code>
        API.</p>

        <p>When a <code><a href="#mediastream">MediaStream</a></code> is
        created to represent a stream obtained from a remote peer, the
        <code><a href="getusermedia.html#dom-mediastream-id">id</a></code>
        attribute is initialized from information provided by the remote
        source.</p>

        <p class="note">The id of a <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> object
        is unique to the source of the stream, but that does not mean it is not
        possible to end up with duplicates. For example, a locally generated
        stream could be sent from one user agent to a remote peer using
        <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> and then sent back to the
        original user agent in the same manner, in which case the original user
        agent will have multiple streams with the same id (the
        locally-generated one and the one received from the remote peer).</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Events on MediaStream</h4>

        <p>A new media track may be associated with an existing
        <code><a>MediaStream</a></code>. For example, if a remote peer adds a
        new <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> object to a
        <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> that is being sent over an
        <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code>, this is observed on the local
        user agent. If this happens for the reason exemplified, or for any
        other reason than the <code><a href=
        "getusermedia.html#dom-mediastream-addtrack">addTrack()</a></code>
        method being invoked locally on a <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> or
        tracks being added as the stream is created (i.e. the stream is
        initialized with tracks), the user agent MUST run the following steps:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Let <var>stream</var> be the target

            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>An existing media track may also be disassociated from a

        than the <code><a href=

        method being invoked locally on a <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> or the
        stream being destroyed, the user agent MUST run the following steps:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Let <var>stream</var> be the target
            <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> object.</p>

      <h3>AudioMediaStreamTrack</h3>

      <p class="note">The DTMF API is undergoing significant list discussion
      and will probably change.</p>

      <p>The <code><a>AudioMediaStreamTrack</a></code> is a specialization of a
      normal <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> that only carries audio and
      is extended to have the capability to send and/or receive DTMF codes.</p>

          DTMF.</p>
        </dd>

          <dfn id="dom-AudioMediaStreamTrack-insertDTMF"><code>insertDTMF()</code></dfn>
          method is invoked, the user agent MUST queue a task that sends the
          DTMF tones.</p>

          <p>The tone parameters is treated as a series of characters. The
          characters 0 through 9, A through D, #, and * generate the associated
          DTMF tones. The characters a to d are equivalent to A to D. The
          character',' indicates a delay of 2 seconds before processing the
          next character in the tones parameter. Unrecognized characters are
          ignored.</p>

          <p>The duration parameter indicates the duration in ms to use for
          each character passed in the tones parameters. The duration cannot be
          more than 6000 or less than 70. The default duration is 100 ms for
          each tone. The gap between tones MUST be at least 50 ms but should be
          as short as possible.</p>

          <p class="issue">ISSUE: How are invalid values handled?</p>

          <p>If insertDTMF is called on the same object while an existing task
          for this object to generate DTMF is still running, the previous task
          is canceled. Calling insertDTMF with an empty tones parameter can be
          used to cancel any tones currently being sent.</p>

          <p class="note">Editor Note: We need to add a callback to insertDTMF
          that is called after the tones are sent. This is needed to allow the
          application to know when it can send new tones without canceling the
          tones that are currently being sent.</p>

          <p class="note">Editor Note: It seems we would want a callback or
          event for incoming tones. The proposal sent to the list had them
          played as audio to the speaker but I don’t see how that is
          useful.</p>

      <h3>Simple Peer-to-peer Example</h3>

      <div>
        <p>When two peers decide they are going to set up a connection to each
        other, they both go through these steps. The STUN/TURN server
        configuration describes a server they can use to get things like their
        public IP address or to set up NAT traversal. They also have to send
        data for the signaling channel to each other using the same out-of-band
        mechanism they used to establish that they were going to communicate in
        the first place.</p>
        <pre class="example sh_javascript">

var signalingChannel = new SignalingChannel();
var configuration = { "iceServers": [{ "url": "stun:stun.example.org" }] };
var pc;

// call start() to initiate
function start() {

      <h3>Peer-to-peer Data Example</h3>

      <div>
        <p>This example shows how to create a
        <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> object and perform the offer/answer
        exchange required to connect the channel to the other peer. The
        <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> is used in the context of a simple
        chat application and listeners are attached to monitor when the channel
        is ready, messages are received and when the channel is closed.</p>

        <p class="note">This example uses the <code>negotiationneeded</code>
        event to initiate the offer/answer dialog. The exact behavior
        surrounding the <code>negotiationneeded</code> event is not specified
        in detail at the moment. This example can hopefully help to drive that
        discussion. An assumption made in this example is that the event only
        triggeres when a new negotiation should be started. This means that an
        action (such as addStream()) that normally would have fired the
        <code>negotiationneeded</code> event will not do so during an ongoing
        offer/answer dialog.</p>

      <p class="issue">ISSUE: there are multiple ways to add constraints. How
      are multiple values reconciled?</p>

      <p>The following new constraints are defined that can be used with an
      <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> object:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>OfferToReceiveVideo</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>This is an enum type constraint that can take the values "true"
          and "false". The default is a non mandatory "true" for an
          <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> object that has a video stream at the
          point in time when the constraints are being evaluated and is non
          mandatory "false" otherwise.</p>

          <p>In some cases, an <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> may wish to
          receive video but not send any video. The
          <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> needs to know if it should signal to
          the remote side whether it wishes to receive video or not. This
          constraint allows an application to indicate its preferences for
          receiving video when creating an offer.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>OfferToReceiveAudio</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>This is an enum type constraint that can take the values "true"
          and "false". The default is a non mandatory "true".</p>

          <p>In some cases, an <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> may wish to
          receive audio but not send any audio. The
          <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> needs to know if it should signal to
          the remote side whether it wishes to receive audio. This constraints
          allows an application to indicate its preferences for receiving audio
          when creating an offer.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>VoiceActivityDetection</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>This is an enum type constraint that can take the values "true"
          and "false". The default is a non mandatory "true".</p>

          <p>Many codecs and system are capable of detecting "silence" and
          changing their behavior in this case by doing things such as not
          transmitting any media. In many cases, such as when dealing with
          sounds other than spoken voice or emergency calling, it is desirable
          to be able to turn off this behavior. This constraint allows the
          application to provide information about whether it wishes this type
          of processing enabled or disabled.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>IceTransports</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>This is an enum type constraint that can take the values "none",
          "relay", and "all". The default is a non mandatory "all".</p>

          <p>This constraint indicates which candidates the ICE engine is
          allowed to use. The value "none" means the ICE engine MUST not send
          or receive any packets at this point. The value "relay" indicates the
          ICE engine MUST only use media relay candidates such as candidates
          passing through a TURN server. This can be used to reduce leakage of
          IP addresses in certain use cases. The value of "all" indicates all
          values can be used.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>RequestIdentity</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>This is an enum type constraint that can take the values "yes",
          "no", and "ifconfigured". The default is a non mandatory
          "ifconfigured".</p>

          <p>This constraint indicates whether an identity should be requested.
          The constraint may be used with either of the
          <code>createOffer()</code> or <code>createAnswer()</code> calls or
          with the constructor. The value "yes" means that an identity must be
          requested. The value "no" means that no identity is to be requested.
          The value "ifconfigured" means that an identity will be requested if
          either the user has configured an identity in the browser or if the
          <code>setIdentityProvider()</code> call has been made in JavaScript.
          As this is the default value, an identity will be requested if and
          only if the user has configured an IdP in some way. Note that as long
          as DTLS-SRTP is in used, fingerprints will be sent regardless of the
          value of this constraint.</p>
